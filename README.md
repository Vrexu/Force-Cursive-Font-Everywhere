# forceCursiveFontEverywhere
This is a TamperMonkey script that changes the font in most places to Segoe Script = the best cursive font for Windows, that I could find, while also trying to break the least of things on the websites.

The script was designed and tested for Windows, and due to the used script being from Microsoft, I expect it NOT to work with Linux/MacOS/others.

Why having a cursive text everywhere, you might ask.
  - For once, I wanted to be able to read handwritten Russian.
  - This might come as a surprise, but I find that a good cursive script to be easier to read (latin alphabet, not cyrillic...). So, if you are dyslexic, I recommend giving it a try.

Feel free to edit the script however. I mostly uploaded it to have it available in the future.
